After a 2-day investigation, I finally figured out how to host static website on [Gitlab] for free. Before this happens, I've been thinking why [Gitlab] is so inconvenient? At least, not as convenient as [Github] or [Bitbucket]?

However, after I finally and successfully configured my [Gitlab] website [https://longervision.gitlab.io/](https://longervision.gitlab.io/), I've got to say: [Gitlab] is actually **fabulous**.

A person really needs to know what he is capable to do, and what he is not. I am **NOBODY**. That is true...

In the end of this **FIRST** blog, it's my **FIRST** time I start to use
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static website, coded in [Ruby]
- [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme (I may try some other fancy ones later)
- [Ruby] language

[Ruby]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/
[Gitlab]:   https://gitlab.com/
[Github]: https://github.com/
[Bitbucket]: https://bitbucket.org/
